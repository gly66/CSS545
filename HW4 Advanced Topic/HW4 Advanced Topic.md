## Current Solutions

To address the security and encryption needs in mobile messaging apps, several key technologies and methodologies have been adopted. Here is a detailed look at some of the predominant solutions:

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)[3][4]

Description: This encryption method ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages, with the data being encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device.	

Examples:	

- WhatsApp: Utilizes the Signal Protocol to provide E2EE for all forms of communication on its platform.
- Signal: Offers E2EE by default, using its own open-source Signal Protocol, which is widely regarded as the gold standard in messaging security.


### Secure Protocols (TLS/SSL)[5][6]

Description: Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.

Examples:	

- Telegram: Employs a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffieâ€“Hellman secure key exchange.
- Viber: Uses TLS to encrypt the messages between the client and the server, ensuring that data in transit cannot be intercepted.

### Multi-Factor Authentication[7]

Description: This security system requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.

Examples:	

- Google Messages: Supports MFA, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts beyond the traditional password.
- Facebook Messenger: Offers users the option to enable two-factor authentication, which requires a second form of identification beyond just the password.

### Self-Destructing Messages[8]

Description: Messages that are programmed to automatically delete after a set time period, enhancing privacy by ensuring sensitive information does not remain on devices indefinitely.

Examples:	

- Snapchat: Known for messages that disappear after they have been viewed or after a set duration.
- Wire: Provides timed messages that disappear from both the sending and receiving devices after the timer expires.

### On-Device Encryption[9]

Description: Encryption of data stored locally on the device, protecting information even if the device itself is compromised.

Examples:	

- Apple iMessage: Uses on-device encryption to protect the data stored on iOS devices, ensuring that messages are only accessible through devices where the user is authenticated.
- Threema: Stores all contact lists and message databases encrypted on the device, using the NaCl cryptography library to provide comprehensive encryption.

## Critical Analysis

As mobile messaging applications continue to serve as a primary means of communication globally, the implemented security and encryption measures must be scrutinized not only for their effectiveness but also for their broader implications. This critical analysis evaluates the pros and cons of prevalent security solutions, shedding light on their real-world applications, inherent limitations, and potential areas for improvement.
